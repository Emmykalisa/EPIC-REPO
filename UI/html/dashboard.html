                When I was in university year one to year two, 
                I did programming courses as to get the pass and be able to move to the next level, 
                I was thinking that programming is for people who studied out of our country because before 
                we knew that we can not do programming unless we studied into international universities.
                It means that I had a fixed mindset because of the belief I had from my society, 
                after reaching in year three(third year) I started learning with more effort b
                ecause of my big brother who advised me to not use lecturer sources only and also to use another 
                sources like youtube, w3schools etc so that I can become a software developer because 
                he knew that I have been liked it so much.

                  <textarea name="body" placeholder="">When I was in university year one to year two, I did programming courses as to get the pass and be able to move to the next level, I was thinking that programming is for people who studied out of our country because before we knew that we can not do programming unless we studied into international universities. It means that I had a fixed mindset because of the belief I had from my society, after reaching in year three(third year) I started learning with more effort because of my big brother who advised me to not use lecturer sources only and also to use another sources like youtube, w3schools etc so that I can become a software developer because he knew that I have been liked it so much.
